Problems of AOC https://adventofcode.com

I love the way AOC creates problems with a story in it. That makes me want to go all the way to the end.

Although, I may not be as eligible to do so.

These are the problems I could solve from 2019 and 2020.

I'm currently working on 2021! This year I feel more confident about going further into the problems.
